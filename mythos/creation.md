## CREATION

It is said that long before anything else existed in the world there was only Usle'A or Arche as it is known in the Prevalent Tongue. Arche was both a being and a place, had unlimited power and a size which reached the ends of everything. Arche is what was, is and will be. It is thought by some that Arche is a God or Deity, the most powerful one but this reasoning lacks proof as there has been no documented encounter with Arche by any civilization or creature. Arche is in essence the driving power behind the life force that flows through every being, creature, animal and plant as everything exist within Arche.

	For how long Arche existed alone it's anyone's guess. It could be thousands of eons or even more. But at some point it's speculated that two beings of unfathomable power with no specific shape and state were formed, either created by Arche or simply came to existence. The names given to them in the Elder Tongue were Nase, meaning Father and Isa which means Mother. Whether they were actually female or male is unspecified and probably not of much importance to them. It is speculated that after a while Mother and Father created the Fahindye, or the Antecedent also known as First Born. They were beings of great potential and even greater power. They were the ones that brought to life the first creatures and placed them in worlds of their own creation. They consequently created more worlds as well as creatures and gave them a language to communicate, the Elder Tongue or Dae'Ara'Thi. They created animals and plants and the first Nilsir or Concepts upon which the first civilizations where based. Those first Concepts had no form or shape but were driven by rules and were deeply embedded in the minds of all living things. All of their names have been lost in time but the most powerful among them were: Love, Law, Light, Death, Dream, Night, Nature, Na'dhel also known as Fate, E'Awale'As also known as Order and Hluar also known as Chaos.

	The Antecedent demanded absolute obedience and constant worship in return for the growth and protection they provided. And some of them begun transforming themselves as mortals in order to partake to carnal or otherwise pleasures with other mortals. From these unions the Ellym or the Elder Gods were born which mortals viewed as their guardians and heroes. Basically the Ellym were the first Gods or Deities that were worshiped by mortals without any threaten of destruction but simply out of love and affection. For that the Antecedent even if the Ellym were their children, started being jealous of them. 

	It is unclear where Mother and Father were during all this time of creation and development. Some think that they left seeking to find where the world ends and others simply think that they were too powerful to even be bothered by such trivial matters. There is also a notion that they simply liked to watch and judge their progeny play with each other. Whatever the case was, soon a war broke out between the Ellym and the Fahindye as the former rebelled against the way their faithful worshipers were treated by the latter. The war lasted for ages and nothing survived, at least nothing of mortal structure. The Fahindye dwindled in numbers as well as the Ellym and they would continue to fight if not for the interference of the Father. Furious with the fighting between them he started destroying them all one by one until all but nine Ellym and two of the Fahindye remained. They sought the protection of Mother and begged to be saved from Father's wrath. 

	Mother then argued with Father that enough death and destruction had occurred already and perhaps other means of punishment could be found. So Father decided to punish them instead starting with the Fahindye, Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs, who were lovers as well. He stripped them of their powers and made them into stars which were placed in the center of the world. But to their further chagrin he placed them close enough to each other that they can never touch and turned them in such a position that they would never be able to look at each other. Also he gave them the power to shine light but when one of them is shining bright the other remains dark until they switch. Until now they remain in the sky and one of them brightens up our days while the other patiently waits for night to fall and shine her silvery glow upon us. He then turned his attention to the Ellym. Their leader, Nymlaser grasped this opportunity to attack and managed to gravely wound the Father. It is then said that Mother begged Arche to let him live so that they can be together forever and Arche turned both of them into pure energy which was then dispersed in all corners of the universe. That energy came to be known as Sihir and is the essence of magic.

	The Nilsir then came to the Ellym and made an offer to create the world anew, together. The Ellym accepted and rules were put in place so that further fighting between them could incur.
