## CREATION

It is said that long before anything else there was only Usle'A or Arche as it is known in the Prevalent Tongue. According to the legends Arche was both a being and a place, had unlimited power and size. Arche is what was and will ever be. Many think of Arche as a God or Deity, quite possibly the eldest and most powerful but this reasoning lacks proof as there has been no documented encounter with Arche by any civilization or creature which leads most scholars to place Arche in a category of its own. Others think that Arche is in essence the driving power behind the life force that flows through every being, creature, animal and plant as everything is said to have been created and exist within Arche itself.

For how long Arche existed alone it's anyone's guess. It could be thousands of eons or even more. But at some point it's speculated that two beings of unfathomable power with no specific shape and state were formed, either created by Arche or simply came to existence. The names given to them by the First Born in the Elder Tongue were Nase, meaning Father and Isa which means Mother. Whether they were actually female or male is unspecified and probably not of much importance to them. It is speculated that after a while Mother and Father created the Fahindye, or the Antecedent also known as First Born. They were beings of great potential and even greater power. They were the ones that brought to life the first creatures and placed them in worlds of their own creation. They consequently created more worlds as well as diverse creatures giving them the ability to communicate, the Elder Tongue or Dae'Ara'Thi. They created animals and plants as well as the first Nilsir or Concepts in the Prevalent Tongue, upon which the first civilizations where based. Those first Concepts weren't beings and had no specific form or shape but were driven by rules nonetheless and were deeply embedded in the minds of all living things. Most of their names have been lost in time but the most powerful among them are still known:

* Love, which was meant to allow the mortals to create meaningful relationships and sequentially grow in numbers 
* Law, which was meant to provide discipline for the mortals
* Light, which serves as the ingrediend for all life and a guiding beacon for those lost
* Dream, which allowed mortals to be everything they wanted to be for a while
* Night or Darkness, which provided cover for those with obscure or even nefarious purposes
* Naw'Eal, Life, the start of every journey for all mortals 
* Lae'Wan, Death, because everything must come to an end in order for the circle of life to start anew
* Na'dhel also known as Fate, which allowed the mortals to find their destiny
* E'Awale'As also known as Order, meant to provide a basic set of rules which would act as guidance for mortals
* Hluar also known as Chaos, meant to provide the mortals freedom to follow their instincts

The Antecedent also are said to have created the Titans, beings of immense size and power which 



demanded absolute obedience and constant worship in return for the growth and protection they provided. And some of them begun transforming themselves as mortals in order to partake to carnal or otherwise pleasures with other mortals. From these unions the Ellym or the Elder Gods were born which mortals viewed as their guardians and heroes. Basically the Ellym were the first Gods or Deities that were worshiped by mortals without any threaten of destruction but simply out of love and affection. For that the Antecedent even if the Ellym were their children, started being jealous of them.

It is unclear where Mother and Father were during all this time of creation and development. Some think that they left seeking to find where the world ends and others simply think that they were too powerful to even be bothered by such trivial matters. There is also a notion that they simply liked to watch and judge their progeny play with each other. Whatever the case was, soon a war broke out between the Ellym and the Fahindye as the former rebelled against the way their faithful worshipers were treated by the latter. The war lasted for ages and nothing survived, at least nothing of mortal structure. The Fahindye dwindled in numbers as well as the Ellym and they would continue to fight if not for the interference of the Father. Furious with the fighting between them he started destroying them all one by one until all but nine Ellym and two of the Fahindye remained. They sought the protection of Mother and begged to be saved from Father's wrath.

Mother then argued with Father that enough death and destruction had occurred already and perhaps other means of punishment could be found. So Father decided to punish them instead starting with the Fahindye, Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs, who were lovers as well. He stripped them of their powers and made them into stars which were placed in the center of the world. But to their further chagrin he placed them close enough to each other that they can never touch and turned them in such a position that they would never be able to look at each other. Also he gave them the power to shine light but when one of them is shining bright the other remains dark until they switch. Until now they remain in the sky and one of them brightens up our days while the other patiently waits for night to fall and shine her silvery glow upon us. He then turned his attention to the Ellym. Their leader, Nymlaser grasped this opportunity to attack and managed to gravely wound the Father. It is then said that Mother begged Arche to let him live so that they can be together forever and Arche turned both of them into pure energy which was then dispersed in all corners of the universe. That energy came to be known as Sihir and is the essence of magic.

The Nilsir then came to the Ellym and made an offer to create the world anew, together. The Ellym accepted and rules were put in place so that further fighting between them could incur.

* Each Ellym would create one and only one world which would remain in the vicinity of Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs, or Sol, Sun and Argent, Moon.
* No Ellym would have the right to interfere with another's world or creations unless asked or given permission to.
* No Ellym would create beings capable of bringing other creatures into existence or creating life.

With those rules in place, Order, Chaos and Fate were placed in charge of advocating and guiding all mortals. Order was responsible for keeping everything in check allowing everyone equal chances and maintaining a certain form. Chaos was responsible for giving the mortals the freedom of choice to the extent that it didn't cause any conflicts with Order. And finally Fate was responsible keeping the balance between Order and Fate as well as act as a guiding hand for mortals. Other Nilsir were given various tasks and the first structured system came into life for the Ellym to create worlds into.

The Ellym chose to create their worlds all around Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs as a sign of respect and so that they could benefit from the life-giving light that they provided. Each Ellym created a world with its name and the suffix Ellym:

* Ze'Auh'Ellym: Ze'Auh created a magnificent world filled with light and love. The only creatures inhabiting this world were the Ashionis, named after his wife, Ashion. The Ashionis or Nef'Ellym as they came to be known in the Elder Tongue, were beings of spectacular beauty, female in appearance with blond hair and splendid white wings. They were constantly meddling in the affairs of mortals in Ashion'Ellym usually in a beneficial way. They lived high up in the air as their world consisted of islands hovering over an endless ocean.
* Sue'Anar'Ellym: Sue'Anar created a world filled with creatures devoid of any sense of order ruled instead by their desires, the Aljan or more commonly known as Daimons. Sue'Anar'Ellym was a world with almost no water consisting of vast areas filled with stones, mountains and desolation. The Aljan are ruled by Laren, who is the unquestionable leader and the strongest among them. When a Laren perishes he or she could be only succeeded by the winner of a tournament, called Laren Vitl. Alternatively anyone could challenge the current Laren to a duel to the death.
* Rus'Ellym: Ruse opted to not create any intelligent creatures, capable of creating civilizations and societies having see where this leads. He created a vast world with lakes, oceans and forests filled with all kinds of animals and plants allowing a natural circle of life amongst the animals and plants of the world.
* Ni'Ellym: Nie, Ze'Auh's twin sister, created a world equally beautiful to her brother's filling him with wondrous beings called Gealach or as they came to be known later, Djinn. Djinn were beings of pure energy and had many forms. They were also immortal, unable to die from natural causes and never age. It is considered that Djinn are the physical manifestations of Sihir, a thought yet to be proven.
* Djak'Ellym: Djaka created an empty world. It was a vast area of nothingness without any water, mountains or any life whatsoever. Even the light was limited, giving the world a constant state of gloom. It is said that he was completely devoid of imagination and thus was unable to create anything of substance. Other Ellym feeling sorry for him allowed the spirits of creatures that perished on their worlds to enter his and stay there wandering forever giving the world a semblance of life.
* Laeth'Ellym: Laethe created a world where no light was ever allowed to shine. She created creatures with no face the Djakolehn or later known as Soulless. It is said she did so because she lacked the emotion of love to pour into her creations thus rendering them incomplete and unable to do anything other than wander aimlessly inside Laeth'Ellym with no purpose.
* Nymlaser'Ellym: Nymlaser, the strongest amongst the Ellym, created a single huge island filled with copies of everything that caught his eye from other worlds. There he placed himself on top of a large throne inside an enormous and luxurious palace surrounded by beautiful creatures to which he gave only one goal in life, to provide him with pleasure. Other Ellym scowled upon seeing this but he didn't break any rules so they were unable to interfere.
* Ashion'Ellym: Ashion first helped everyone else to create their world. Then getting ideas from most of them created her world which is now known as Crel. Having helped the other Ellym they were thankful to her and so each one of them gave a present to be placed in her world. Rus'Ellym gave a pair of each animal and plant from his world. Nie poured magic in the world giving great power to its denizens. Djaka allowed the spirits of the deceased to wander into the dreams of the living giving them some contact with their loved ones. Sue'Anar gave the creatures of Crel the freedom to choose their own destiny according to their desires. Laethe gave her Djakolehn orders to guide the fallen spirits to and from Djak'Ellym while Nymlaser, against Ashion's wishes gave all the creatures the lust for power. Finally Ze'Auh allowed the Ashionis to mate with the mortals creating a new race, the Ash'Alo'As the ancestors of the Lightborn or Adlae. With all these gifts Ashion created a vast world, bigger than any of the other worlds varying in nature and life.
* Shkr'Ellym: Everything that remained of the Old Worlds, the ones created by the Antecedent was placed in a single world as a sign of respect. Mostly it was structures and other things left behind and in that regard Shkr'Ellym remained empty of life giving it a sense of abandonment and loneliness. Few ever visited this world and even less few chose to stay for prolonged periods of time.

### THE FIRST DOWNFALL OF THE GODS

For ages everything was peaceful among the worlds and the Ellym. Despite some provocations here and there peace was maintained. That is until supposedly the some of the Djakolehn found their way through to the world of Djak’Ellym. There it was discovered in everyone’s horror that they possessed the ability to absorb the essence of the soul that someone possessed. This gave them a temporary excitement that they had never felt before and as the realm of Djak’Ellym was filled with souls soon it became their favorite sport to hunt down and absorb the souls wandering the realm.

Appalled by this Ashion sought out to get the help of her husband and Nie to wage war against Laethe and her creatures. Order intervened reminding her of the rules preventing such fights between them and argued that these souls were already dead so if it gave them a little of happiness it wasn’t much to stomach for the greater good. Given that Nie refused to help Ashion stood down and decided to let the issue go. Soon though the Djakolehn discovered that with absorbing these souls they gained power which allowed them to travel between worlds. And so they found a way through to Ashion’Ellym where they were able to absorb fresh souls straight from someone still alive.

This enraged Ashion who abandoning all reason attacked Laethe without any warning who managed to defend herself and retreat. This instigated a new war between the Ellym with Nie and Ze’Auh siding with Ashion while Nymlaser and Sue’Anar sided with Laethe. Djaka and Ruse decided to not partake to the fighting. The war quickly claimed countless casualties on both sides but soon the balance tipped in favor of Laethe’s side. It was then that Nie tricked Ruse into believing that his world came under attack thus leaving him with little choice but to join the fray. The balance changed and soon Ashion’s side begun winning and all seemed that would come to an end soon.

The Ellym were fighting alongside their own creations as well as various other Deities that were created during this time by their union with mortals. These Deities had varying degrees of power but it was enough to compete against their parents. It’s not clear how, but Ruse learned that he was tricked by Nie into fighting which resulted in him killing her in cold blood and withdrawing himself from the war. The Djinn taken aback by the death of their Creator were forced to retreat after suffering heavy losses which gave a significant advantage to the forces of Laethe. Desperate to win, Ashion created a weapon of tremendous power from the blood of Nie which gave the power to its wielder to strike down anyone, even an Ellym. She trusted this weapon to her best fighter and daughter, Lyanthe D’Moor. Lyanthe managed to kill Nymlaser after tricking him into believing that her weapon was useless after all. Sue’Anar then withdrew from the fight, frightened by the power of the weapon. With this the balance tipped back in favor of Ashion and Ze’Auh.

The mortals fed up with fighting this war and the losses they had to suffer just because the Gods decided to fight with Lyanthe as their leader rebelled against their creators. Choices had to be made, and on one side now all the mortals stood with Lyanthe as their leader while on the other side the remaining Ellym banded together with the help of the Ashionis, the Djakolehn and the Djinn. Ruse elected to remain out of the battle, one more time which was respected by both sides. Some of the Ashionis and Djinn decided to help the mortals and thus the war began anew. The Ashionis and Djinn on the side of the mortals gave them tremendous powers and even created magical living suits of armor for them, the Kreth’Naal. The war lasted ages and in the end, all but ruins remained of Ashion’Ellym and the other worlds. Only Rus’Ellym remained mainly untouched by the ravages of war.

During the process of the war Lyanthe managed to kill Laethe and strike down Ashion which prompted a frenzied attack from Ze’Auh leading to his demise as well. She then took charge and asked the remaining forces of the Ellym to stand down as she believed they could come to a peaceful arrangement. And an agreement was made.

* All connections between the worlds would be severed completely. The spirit of mortals who died would still end up in Djak’Ellym though, but no spirit would be allowed to contact the world of the living again.
* The remaining Ellym, Ruse, Sue’Anar and Djaka would remain in their respective worlds and would never interfere with matters of other worlds.
* And finally because all the war took ages which made some mortals create bonds with other worlds than theirs, it was allowed for everyone to choose the world they wanted to live in before all connections were severed.

### THE FINAL DEMISE OF THE GODS

> Nathaniel Desmond Whytelaw

For a long period of time there was peace between the realms of Etaen, helped by the fact that the links allowing someone to pass from one to another were gone. Specifically in the world of Crel, the Mortal Realm there was growth. The Demigods \(the children of the Ellym\), Ashionis and Djinn which chose to remain there were revered as Gods and soon a Pantheon was created. The main Gods worshipped by the mortals were:

* Lyanthe rose to godhood and was given several nicknames, Godslayer being the prevailing one. She was thought as the Goddess of Freedom, Protection and Judgement.
* Voljane was thought to be the God of Building, Smithing and Mining
* Neysa was thought to be the Goddess of Sea, Rivers and Lakes.
* Askeris was thought as the God of Honor, Governance and Law.
* Avonne was thought as the Goddess of War, Vengeance and Revenge
* The twins Shyvina and Vynisha were thought as the Goddesses of Life & Death.
* Zubair was thought as the god of Fire and Lightning.
* Leametria was thought as the Goddess of Passion and Love.
* Terrasina was thought as the Goddess of Earth, Forests and Mountains.
* Delroth was thought as the God of Magic

And the list goes on. Practically every mortal race chose to believe in different gods and deities. Others chose to worship the Dragons, beings of immense power which originated from the world of Rus’Ellym. They opted to defy the wishes of their creator, Ruse and fight alongside the mortals against the Ellym.
