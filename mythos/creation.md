## CREATION

> Did the gods forsake us? Or did we abandon them, long before that, by forgetting their teachings and sacrifices?

It is said that long before anything else existed in the world there was only Usle'A or Arche as it is known in the Prevalent Tongue. Arche was both a being and a place, had unlimited power and a size which reached the ends of everything. Arche is what was, is and will be. It is thought by some that Arche is a God or Deity, the most powerful one but this reasoning lacks proof as there has been no documented encounter with Arche by any civilization or creature. Arche is in essence the driving power behind the life force that flows through every being, creature, animal and plant as everything exist within Arche.

For how long Arche existed alone it's anyone's guess. It could be thousands of eons or even more. But at some point it's speculated that two beings of unfathomable power with no specific shape and state were formed, either created by Arche or simply came to existence. The names given to them in the Elder Tongue were Nase, meaning Father and Isa which means Mother. Whether they were actually female or male is unspecified and probably not of much importance to them. It is speculated that after a while Mother and Father created the Fahindye, or the Antecedent also known as First Born. They were beings of great potential and even greater power. They were the ones that brought to life the first creatures and placed them in worlds of their own creation. They consequently created more worlds as well as creatures and gave them a language to communicate, the Elder Tongue or Dae'Ara'Thi. They created animals and plants and the first Nilsir or Concepts upon which the first civilizations where based. Those first Concepts had no form or shape but were driven by rules and were deeply embedded in the minds of all living things. All of their names have been lost in time but the most powerful among them were: Love, Law, Light, Death, Dream, Night, Nature, Na'dhel also known as Fate, E'Awale'As also known as Order and Hluar also known as Chaos.

The Antecedent demanded absolute obedience and constant worship in return for the growth and protection they provided. And some of them begun transforming themselves as mortals in order to partake to carnal or otherwise pleasures with other mortals. From these unions the Ellym or the Elder Gods were born which mortals viewed as their guardians and heroes. Basically the Ellym were the first Gods or Deities that were worshiped by mortals without any threaten of destruction but simply out of love and affection. For that the Antecedent even if the Ellym were their children, started being jealous of them.

It is unclear where Mother and Father were during all this time of creation and development. Some think that they left seeking to find where the world ends and others simply think that they were too powerful to even be bothered by such trivial matters. There is also a notion that they simply liked to watch and judge their progeny play with each other. Whatever the case was, soon a war broke out between the Ellym and the Fahindye as the former rebelled against the way their faithful worshipers were treated by the latter. The war lasted for ages and nothing survived, at least nothing of mortal structure. The Fahindye dwindled in numbers as well as the Ellym and they would continue to fight if not for the interference of the Father. Furious with the fighting between them he started destroying them all one by one until all but nine Ellym and two of the Fahindye remained. They sought the protection of Mother and begged to be saved from Father's wrath.

Mother then argued with Father that enough death and destruction had occurred already and perhaps other means of punishment could be found. So Father decided to punish them instead starting with the Fahindye, Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs, who were lovers as well. He stripped them of their powers and made them into stars which were placed in the center of the world. But to their further chagrin he placed them close enough to each other that they can never touch and turned them in such a position that they would never be able to look at each other. Also he gave them the power to shine light but when one of them is shining bright the other remains dark until they switch. Until now they remain in the sky and one of them brightens up our days while the other patiently waits for night to fall and shine her silvery glow upon us. He then turned his attention to the Ellym. Their leader, Nymlaser grasped this opportunity to attack and managed to gravely wound the Father. It is then said that Mother begged Arche to let him live so that they can be together forever and Arche turned both of them into pure energy which was then dispersed in all corners of the universe. That energy came to be known as Sihir and is the essence of magic.

The Nilsir then came to the Ellym and made an offer to create the world anew, together. The Ellym accepted and rules were put in place so that further fighting between them could incur.

		\* Each Ellym would create one and only one world which would remain in the vicinity of Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs, or Sol, Sun and Argent, Moon.

		\* No Ellym would have the right to interfere with another's world or creations unless asked or given permission to.

		\* No Ellym would create beings capable of bringing other creatures into existence or creating life.

	With those rules in place, Order, Chaos and Fate were placed in charge of advocating and guiding all mortals. Order was responsible for keeping everything in check allowing everyone equal chances and maintaining a certain form. Chaos was responsible for giving the mortals the freedom of choice to the extent that it didn't cause any conflicts with Order. And finally Fate was responsible keeping the balance between Order and Fate as well as act as a guiding hand for mortals. Other Nilsir were given various tasks and the first structured system came into life for the Ellym to create worlds into.

	The Ellym chose to create their worlds all around Araz'Uhs and Shyl'Uhs as a sign of respect and so that they could benefit from the life-giving light that they provided. Each Ellym created a world with its name and the suffix Ellym:

		Ze'Auh'Ellym: Ze'Auh created a magnificent world filled with light and love. The only creatures inhabiting this world were the Ashionis, named after his wife, Ashion. The Ashionis or Nef'Ellym as they came to be known in the Elder Tongue, were beings of spectacular beauty, female in appearance with blond hair and splendid white wings. They were constantly meddling in the affairs of mortals in Ashion'Ellym usually in a beneficial way. They lived high up in the air as their world consisted of islands hovering over an endless ocean.

		Sue'Anar'Ellym: Sue'Anar created a world filled with creatures devoid of any sense of order ruled instead by their desires, the Aljan or more commonly known as Daimons. Sue'Anar'Ellym was a world with almost no water consisting of vast areas filled with stones, mountains and desolation. The Aljan are ruled by Laren, who is the unquestionable leader and the strongest among them. When a Laren perishes he or she could be only succeeded by the winner of a tournament, called Laren Vitl. Alternatively anyone could challenge the current Laren to a duel to the death.

		Rus'Ellym: Ruse opted to not create any intelligent creatures, capable of creating civilizations and societies having see where this leads. He created a vast world with lakes, oceans and forests filled with all kinds of animals and plants allowing a natural circle of life amongst the animals and plants of the world.

		Ni'Ellym: Nie, Ze'Auh's twin sister, created a world equally beautiful to her brother's filling him with wondrous beings called Gealach or as they came to be known later, Djinn. Djinn were beings of pure energy and had many forms. They were also immortal, unable to die from natural causes and never age. It is considered that Djinn are the physical manifestations of Sihir, a thought yet to be proven.

		Djak'Ellym: Djaka created an empty world. It was a vast area of nothingness without any water, mountains or any life whatsoever. Even the light was limited, giving the world a constant state of gloom. It is said that he was completely devoid of imagination and thus was unable to create anything of substance. Other Ellym feeling sorry for him allowed the spirits of creatures that perished on their worlds to enter his and stay there wandering forever giving the world a semblance of life.

		Laeth'Ellym: Laethe created a world where no light was ever allowed to shine. She created creatures with no face the Djakolehn or later known as Soulless. It is said she did so because she lacked the emotion of love to pour into her creations thus rendering them incomplete and unable to do anything other than wander aimlessly inside Laeth'Ellym with no purpose.

		Nymlaser'Ellym: Nymlaser, the strongest amongst the Ellym, created a single huge island filled with copies of everything that caught his eye from other worlds. There he placed himself on top of a large throne inside an enormous and luxurious palace surrounded by beautiful creatures to which he gave only one goal in life, to provide him with pleasure. Other Ellym scowled upon seeing this but he didn't break any rules so they were unable to interfere.

		Ashion'Ellym: Ashion first helped everyone else to create their world. Then getting ideas from most of them created her world which is now known as Crel. Having helped the other Ellym they were thankful to her and so each one of them gave a present to be placed in her world. Rus'Ellym gave a pair of each animal and plant from his world. Nie poured magic in the world giving great power to its denizens. Djaka allowed the spirits of the deceased to wander into the dreams of the living giving them some contact with their loved ones. Sue'Anar gave the creatures of Crel the freedom to choose their own destiny according to their desires. Laethe gave her Djakolehn orders to guide the fallen spirits to and from Djak'Ellym while Nymlaser, against Ashion's wishes gave all the creatures the lust for power. Finally Ze'Auh allowed the Ashionis to mate with the mortals creating a new race, the Ash'Alo'As the ancestors of the Lightborn or Adlae. With all these gifts Ashion created a vast world, bigger than any of the other worlds varying in nature and life.

		Shkr'Ellym: Everything that remained of the Old Worlds, the ones created by the Antecedent was placed in a single world as a sign of respect. Mostly it was structures and other things left behind and in that regard Shkr'Ellym remained empty of life giving it a sense of abandonment and loneliness. Few ever visited this world and even less few chose to stay for prolonged periods of time.
