## CREATION

> Did the gods forsake us? Or did we abandon them, long before that, by forgetting their teachings and sacrifices?

It is said that long before anything else existed in the world there was only Usle'A or Arche as it is known in the Prevalent Tongue. Arche was both a being and a place, had unlimited power and a size which reached the ends of everything. Arche is what was, is and will be. It is thought by some that Arche is a God or Deity, the most powerful one but this reasoning lacks proof as there has been no documented encounter with Arche by any civilization or creature. Arche is in essence the driving power behind the life force that flows through every being, creature, animal and plant as everything exist within Arche.

For how long Arche existed alone it's anyone's guess. It could be thousands of eons or even more. But at some point it's speculated that two beings of unfathomable power with no specific shape and state were formed, either created by Arche or simply came to existence. The names given to them in the Elder Tongue were Nase, meaning Father and Isa which means Mother. Whether they were actually female or male is unspecified and probably not of much importance to them. It is speculated that after a while Mother and Father created the Fahindye, or the Antecedent also known as First Born. They were beings of great potential and even greater power. They were the ones that brought to life the first creatures and placed them in worlds of their own creation. They consequently created more worlds as well as creatures and gave them a language to communicate, the Elder Tongue or Dae'Ara'Thi. They created animals and plants and the first Nilsir or Concepts upon which the first civilizations where based. Those first Concepts had no form or shape but were driven by rules and were deeply embedded in the minds of all living things. All of their names have been lost in time but the most powerful among them were: Love, Law, Light, Death, Dream, Night, Nature, Na'dhel also known as Fate, E'Awale'As also known as Order and Hluar also known as Chaos.
